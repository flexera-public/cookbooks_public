  "long_description": "= RightScale Database Manager for MySQL (Beta) \n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nProvides the MySQL implementation of the 'db' resource to install and \nmanage MySQL database stand-alone servers and clients.\n\n\n== DETAILS\n\nThe 'db' implementation is defined by a Lightweight Provider, which can be \nfound in the providers/default.rb file.\n\nThe majority of the functionality of the MySQL provider is encapsulated \nin the premium rightscale_tools gem, however, there are currently a handful\nof recipes that can be used without it. See 'Public Recipes' in the USAGE\nsection below.\n\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage \n\n* Tested on CentOS 5.6 RightImage\n\n* Supports MySQL 5.1 \n\n* Needs RightScale Premium ServerTemplate tools gem installed on system.\n  This gem is only available for paid RightScale customers.\n  Please contact sales@rightscale.com to upgrade you account.\n\n\n== SETUP:\n\n* Place db::default recipe into your runlist to setup the db resource.  When\n  using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically add the \n  common database attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs.\n   \n* Also, place the db_mysql::default recipe into your runlist to load the\n  MySQL provider, tuning parameters, as well as other MySQL specific \n  attributes in as inputs.\n\n== USAGE:\n\n=== Basic usage\nOnce setup, use the recipes in the 'db' cookbook to install and manage your\nMySQL database servers and clients.  See the db/README.rdoc for usage \ndetails.\n\n\n=== MySQL Tuning and my.cnf\n\nCustom tuning parameters can be applied by overriding the mysql_tuning.rb\nattributes file.  For more information and an example override repository\nplease see:\n\n  https://github.com/ekargard/cookbooks_override/tree/master/cookbooks/db_mysql\n  \n\n=== Public Recipes\nHere is the list of db recipes that can be used without the preimum \nrightscale_tools gem:\n\n* db::default\n* db::install_client\n* db::install_server\n* db::setup_monitoring\n* db::setup_privileges_admin\n* db::setup_privileges_application\n* db::do_appserver_allow\n* db::do_appserver_deny\n* db::request_appserver_allow\n* db::request_appserver_deny\n\nThese recipes are used by the RightScale LAMP ServerTemplate.\n\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS\n\n* none\n\n\n   \n\n",

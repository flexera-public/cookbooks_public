Since this sets up the app provider, it must be run before the \r\n  app::default recipe (which expects a provider to already be set)\r\n* When using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically add the\r\n  common attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs.\r\n\r\n== USAGE:\r\n\r\n* Template can be combined in two modes:\r\n\r\n  1 For apps with bundler support\r\n    You have to add \"install_required app gems\" recipe, and \"run_custom_rails_commands\" for migration commands\r\n  2 For apps without bundler support\r\n    You have to add \"install_custom_gems\"  recipe, and \"run_custom_rails_commands\" for migration commands\r\n  Anyway you can mix these recipes to fit needs of your project.\r\n\r\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS\r\n\r\n* none\r\n\r\n== DETAILS\r\n\r\nRubyEE packages coming from official RubyEE project page\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/rubyenterpriseedition/downloads/detail?name=ruby-enterprise-1.8.7-2011.03.tar.gz&can=2&q=\r\nconfigured and packed for Ubuntu CentOS and RHEL.\r\n\r\n= LICENSE\r\n\r\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

= RightScale Database Manager for PostgreSQL (Beta)

== DESCRIPTION:

Provides the PostgreSQL implementation of the 'db' resource to install and
manage PostgreSQL database stand-alone servers and clients.


== DETAILS

The 'db' implementation is defined by a Lightweight Provider, which can be
found in the providers/default.rb file.

The majority of the functionality of the PostgreSQL provider is encapsulated
in the premium rightscale_tools gem, however, there are currently a handful
of recipes that can be used without it. See 'Public Recipes' in the USAGE
section below.


== REQUIREMENTS:

* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage

* Tested on CentOS 5.6 RightImage

* Supports PostgreSQL 9.1

* Needs RightScale Premium ServerTemplate tools gem installed on system.
  This gem is only available for paid RightScale customers.
  Please contact sales@rightscale.com to upgrade you account.

== SETUP:

* Place db::default recipe into your runlist to setup the db resource.  When
  using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically add the
  common database attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs.

* Also, place the db_postgres::default recipe into your runlist to load the
  PostgreSQL provider, tuning parameters, as well as other PostgreSQL specific
  attributes in as inputs.

== USAGE:

=== Basic usage
Once setup, use the recipes in the 'db' cookbook to install and manage your
PostgreSQL database servers and clients.  See the db/README.rdoc for usage
details.


=== PostgreSQL Tuning and postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf

Custom tuning parameters can be applied by overriding the postgres_tuning.rb
attributes file.  For more information and an example override repository
please see:

  https://github.com/ravibhure/cookbooks_public/tree/master/cookbooks/db_postgres


=== Public Recipes

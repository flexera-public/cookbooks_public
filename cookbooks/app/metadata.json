Add the default recipe to tag your server as an appserver. This is used by\n   servers (like databases) to identify their clients.\n2. Add desired app::do_* recipes to your application server ServerTemplate\n3. Develop corresponding providers in your application server cookbook.\n4. Define required and recommended attributes in your application server cookbook attributes file.\n\n == DETAILS:\n\nNote: app[default] resource uses \"persist true\" flag, which allow to save created resource and its attributes in memory for future use.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n1. node[:app][:provider] must be defined\n2. app::default recipe must be present in ServerTemplate boot section.\n\n= LICENSE\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

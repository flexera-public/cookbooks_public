Add the default recipe to tag your server as an appserver. This is used by \r\n   servers (like databases) to identify their clients.\r\n2. Add desired app::do_* recipes to your application server ServerTemplate\r\n3. Develop corresponding providers in your application server cookbook.\r\n4. Define required and recommended attributes in your application server cookbook attributes file.\r\n\r\n == DETAILS:\r\n\r\nNote: app[default] resource uses \"persist true\" flag, which allow to save created resource and its attributes in memory for future use.\r\n\r\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\r\n\r\n1. node[:app][:provider] must be defined\r\n2. app::default recipe must be present in ServerTemplate boot section.\r\n\r\n= LICENSE\r\n\r\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.

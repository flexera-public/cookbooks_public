Since this sets up the app provider, it must be run before the\r\n  app::default recipe (which expects a provider to already be set)\r\n* When using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically add the\r\n  common attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs.\r\n\r\n== USAGE:\r\n\r\n* Choose image and cloud.\r\n* Fill required input fields.\r\n\r\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\r\n\r\n* none\r\n\r\n= LICENSE\r\n\r\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
